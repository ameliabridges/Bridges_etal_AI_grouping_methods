Code for comparing how image annotation to different taxonomic levels impacts CNN performance

The R and oython scripts are available in this repository. The image and annotation data is hosted on BIIGLE [here](https://biigle.de/volumes/23748). To access this, you must set up a BIIGLE account and contact Professor Kerry Howell (kho@pml.ac.uk), asking to be added to the project.
